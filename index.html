            <p>A rainbow is an optical phenomenon that occurs when sunlight passes through raindrops in the atmosphere. The light is refracted (bent), reflected inside the droplets, and then dispersed into different colors. This creates a multicolored arc across the sky. Rainbows are usually seen when the sun is behind the viewer and rain is falling in the opposite direction.</p>

        <h2>Volcanic Eruption</h2>
        <p>An explosive burst of lava, ash, and gases from inside the Earth.</p>
        <button>Learn more...</button>
        <div class="detailsHidden">
            <p>Volcanic eruptions happen when pressure builds up beneath the Earth's surface and molten rock (magma), gases, and ash are released through a volcano. These eruptions can be gentle or explosive and can shape entire landscapes. They also release nutrients into the soil but can be dangerous to people, animals, and the climate.</p>

        <h2>Snow in the Desert</h2>
        <p>A rare and surprising sight of snow covering hot, arid landscapes.</p>

        <div class="detailsHidden">
            <p>Snowfall in desert regions is a rare phenomenon due to the typically hot and dry climate. However, when temperatures drop unusually low and there's enough moisture in the air, snow can fall even in deserts like the Sahara. These events are brief but create breathtaking and unusual scenery.</p>

        <h2>Tornado</h2>
        <p>A fast-spinning column of air that touches both the ground and a storm cloud.</p>

        <div class="detailsHidden">
            <p>A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. It forms when warm, moist air collides with cold, dry air, creating instability in the atmosphere. Tornadoes can cause severe damage with strong winds, often destroying buildings and trees along their path.</p>

        <div class="detailsHidden">
            <p>A tsunami is a series of huge sea waves caused by underwater disturbances such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. The waves can travel across oceans at high speeds and become extremely tall and destructive when they reach the shore. Tsunamis can flood coastal areas and cause major loss of life and property.</p>

        <p>Shimmering lights dancing across polar skies caused by solar particles.</p>
        <button>Learn more...</button>
        <div class="detailsHidden">
            <p>The Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, occur when charged particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth’s upper atmosphere near the magnetic poles. These interactions create glowing lights that dance in the sky, typically in green, pink, and purple shades. They are best seen in high-latitude regions during the winter.</p>

        <h2>Sandstorm</h2>
        <p>Powerful winds that lift sand or dust into the air, reducing visibility.</p>
        <button>Learn more...</button>
        <div class="detailsHidden">
            <p>A sandstorm (or dust storm) happens when strong winds blow loose sand and dust from the ground into the air. These storms are common in arid and semi-arid regions and can reduce visibility, affect breathing, and damage electronics. Some sandstorms can travel thousands of kilometers across continents.</p>

        <h2>Meteor Strike</h2>
        <p>A bright streak across the sky as a space rock enters Earth's atmosphere.</p>
        <button>Learn more...</button>
        <div class="detailsHidden">
            <p>When a meteoroid from space enters Earth’s atmosphere, it burns up due to friction with the air, creating a bright streak of light known as a meteor. If a large piece survives the journey and lands on Earth, it’s called a meteorite. Meteors are often seen during showers when many pass through the sky in a short time.</p>
